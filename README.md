CIS 1051 Final Project (Python)


Adversities faced during this project:

  1. Initializing Pygame using the windows command line.
        This was fixed by adjusting the Python interpereter being utilized for Pygame.
     
  2. Regenerating the user on the same y-coordinate in the Pygame screen.
        This was fixed by adding an update to handle jumping. Therefore, if the user was jumping prior to death, they'd be placed back to where they had initially started.

  3. Placing spikes
       I initially had hoped to import the random module and use integers to generate the spikes. However, the spikes would generate too closely. Instead, I decided to space out the spikes evenly.


Enjoyable Aspects:

  1. Problem solving by watching videos to further expand my knowledge regarding Pygame.
     
  2. Using creativity for implementing backgrounds and images.
